        <p>Hello! My name is Emily Miles, and I am a beginner web developer. I have a bachelor's degree in math
            an associate's degree in computer science. I am also two classes shy of having a bachelor's degree in physics as well.
            I'm a huge cat lover. I own two cats and feed some feral cats as well.
